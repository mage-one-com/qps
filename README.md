# Quick Protection System (QPS)

QPS is a request inspection module for Magento 1 stores. It receives its rule sets via the API of https://mage-one.com/.

# Important

The Magento cron job needs to run in order to obtain updated rule sets.

# Install

Make sure your **Magento cronjob** is running. 

### with composer

1. Add the repository with the module:

        "repositories": [
            {
                "type": "vcs",
                "url": "git@github.com:mage-one-com/qps.git"
            }
        ],

2. `composer require mage_one_com/qps`

### with modman

    modman clone git@github.com:mage-one-com/qps.git

### manually
[Download zip file](https://github.com/mage-one-com/qps/archive/master.zip) and copy the files from inside the `src` folder into your magento root directory

## Clean cache/run install scripts

After cleaning the cache, the install scripts should run automatically to create the table for the rules.
In order to see the rules page and configuration, logout and login again.

# Usage

You can find the list of downloaded rules in `System > Tools > Mage One QPS Rules`


## Username + key
To use the QPS you need to [add your username and key in the configuration](https://my.mage-one.com/qps):

    System > Konfiguration > General > Quick Protection System

## Configuration

### Access credentials and rules enabling
The rule processing must be enabled manually in `System > Config > Quick Protection System > Configuration`. 

Rules can be automatically enabled after the hourly API sync, although we recommend enabling rules manually after testing them (this is our default setting).
Enabling or disabling rules is possible in `System > Tools > MageOne QPS Rules`

You have to enter a username and public key, which you can obtain from [https://my.mage-one.com/qps](https://my.mage-one.com/qps)

### Notification of new rules

You can send an email once new rules have been fetched. Configure the recipient's email address and enable the notification in `System > Tools > MageOne QPS Rules > Notification`   

# How does it work?

Our module filters malicious requests based on rules. These rules will be provided by our API, which is part of [https://mage-one.com/](https://mage-one.com/). Rules are usually based on regex inspections of the _GLOBALS data.

Rules will be fetched from the API every hour and only cover vulnerabilities that aren't patched with Mage One Patches yet. Therefor our extension provides the API with a list of all installed Mage One patches. Our API then decides which rules have to be returned.

# How can I test it?

After a successful installation and configuration you can enable our test rule `MO-TEST` and access `<your-shop-url>/mageone/test/rule/?malicious=<script>`. The result should be a blank page.

After this test, please disable our test rule again.


# Uninstall
## with composer
- Remove module from `composer.json` and rerun `composer update mageone/qps`
- Drop the rules table: `DROP TABLE <prefix>mageone_qps_rules;`

## with modman or manually
- Remove the files from your installation
- Drop the rules table: `DROP TABLE <prefix>mageone_qps_rules;`

# Help

If you want to trigger the rule synchronisation manually, you can trigger the cron job via [n98-magerun](https://github.com/netz98/n98-magerun)
```
php n98-magerun.phar sys:cron:run qps_getrules
```
